## 🔄 Practical Workflows

### 🌟 Daily Development Flow
```bash
# 1. Start your day
"Check git status and show recent changes"
# → terminal.mdc chains commands efficiently

# 2. Begin new feature
"Create a user authentication service"
# → anti-duplication checks existing auth first
# → commonsense ensures clean architecture

# 3. Hit an error
"Debug TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined"
# → debugging.mdc provides systematic approach
# → efficiency.mdc minimizes tool calls

# 4. Refactor code
"Refactor this function to be more maintainable"
# → commonsense applies best practices
# → anti-duplication ensures no duplication
```

### 🐛 Bug Investigation Flow
```bash
# 1. Initial assessment
"Analyze this error and recent changes"
# → debugging.mdc does triage in 1 call

# 2. Reproduction
"Create minimal test case for this bug"
# → debugging.mdc isolates issue
# → efficiency.mdc batches operations

# 3. Fix and verify
"Apply fix and verify with tests"
# → terminal.mdc chains test commands
# → debugging.mdc ensures verification
```

### 🏗️ Architecture Decision Flow
```bash
# 1. Evaluate options
"Should we use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for this project?"
# → ADR.mdc triggers decision template
# → commonsense evaluates complexity

# 2. Document decision
"Create ADR for database choice"
# → ADR.mdc creates structured record
# → development-journal captures context

# 3. Implementation
"Set up PostgreSQL with best practices"
# → efficiency.mdc optimizes setup
# → terminal.mdc chains commands
```

### 🚀 Feature Development Flow
```bash
# 1. Check existing code
"Implement user profile feature"
# → anti-duplication searches for existing profiles
# → memory-management loads relevant context

# 2. Design approach
"What's the simplest way to implement profiles?"
# → commonsense prevents over-engineering
# → efficiency suggests optimal approach

# 3. Implementation
"Create profile model, service, and controller"
# → anti-duplication verifies each component
# → terminal.mdc optimizes file creation

# 4. Testing
"Write comprehensive tests for profile feature"
# → debugging.mdc provides test patterns
# → efficiency batches test execution
```

## 💡 Power User Tips

### 🎯 Command Patterns

#### Efficiency Maximizers
```bash
# Bundle operations
"Create component with test, story, and styles in one go"

# Batch analysis
"Analyze all TypeScript files for unused exports"

# Smart search
"Find all API endpoints and their test coverage"
```

#### Debug Accelerators
```bash
# Quick triage
"Debug context for current error state"

# Pattern match
"Find similar bugs in codebase history"

# Performance check
"Profile this function and suggest optimizations"
```

#### Terminal Optimizers
```bash
# Complex workflows
"Set up new microservice with Docker, tests, and CI"

# Batch operations
"Update all package.json files in monorepo"

# Smart git workflows
"Interactive rebase last 5 commits with squash"
```

### 📊 Metrics to Track

#### Efficiency Metrics
```yaml
Before MDC Rules:
- Average tool calls per task: 8-12
- Terminal commands per operation: 6-10
- Debug time per bug: 30-45 min
- Duplicate code incidents: 2-3 per week

After MDC Rules:
- Average tool calls per task: 2-4 (-70%)
- Terminal commands per operation: 1-3 (-80%)
- Debug time per bug: 10-20 min (-60%)
- Duplicate code incidents: 0 (-100%)
```

### 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

#### Pitfall 1: Too Many Rules
**Symptom**: AI becomes overly cautious, slow responses
**Solution**: Start with essential 5, add others gradually

#### Pitfall 2: Conflicting Rules
**Symptom**: Contradictory suggestions
**Solution**: Check rule overlap, disable redundant ones

#### Pitfall 3: Over-reliance on Rules
**Symptom**: AI won't make simple decisions
**Solution**: Rules guide, not dictate - use common sense

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Applying?
```bash
# Check 1: File pattern match
- Verify glob patterns in rule header
- Check file extension

# Check 2: Rule conflicts
- Temporarily disable other rules
- Test in isolation

# Check 3: Cursor restart
- Save all files
- Restart Cursor IDE
- Rules reload on startup
```

### Performance Issues?
```bash
# Reduce active rules
- Disable session-coordinator if not needed
- Remove development-journal for speed
- Keep only essential 5

# Optimize rule content
- Remove verbose examples
- Focus on patterns only
- Under 500 lines per rule
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Measuring Success
```javascript
// Track your improvements
const metrics = {
  toolCallsPerSession: [], // Should decrease
  bugsResolvedTime: [],    // Should decrease
  codeQualityScore: [],    // Should increase
  duplicateIncidents: []   // Should be zero
};

// Weekly review
"Generate efficiency report for this week"
"Show tool call optimization trends"
"Analyze debugging time improvements"
```

### ROI Calculation
```yaml
Time Saved Per Week:
- Terminal optimization: 2-3 hours
- Anti-duplication: 1-2 hours  
- Efficient debugging: 3-4 hours
- Smart context: 1-2 hours

Total: 7-11 hours/week saved
Cost: 0 (one-time setup)
ROI: 20-30% productivity gain
```

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### Custom Rule Creation
```markdown
---
description: Project-specific patterns
globs: ["src/**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Project Patterns

## Component Creation
Always use our custom generator:
\`\`\`bash
npm run generate:component ComponentName
\`\`\`

## State Management  
Use Zustand, not Redux:
\`\`\`javascript
import { create } from 'zustand'
\`\`\`
```

### Rule Composition
```bash
# Combine rules for specific tasks
"Use debugging + efficiency for performance issues"
"Apply terminal + anti-duplication for project setup"
"Activate all rules for architecture decisions"
```
