# Adding New .cursorrules Files

## Overview
Guide for creating and organizing new `.cursorrules` files to enhance Cursor IDE behavior for specific use cases.

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive, kebab-case names that clearly indicate the purpose:
- `debugging.mdc` - General debugging optimization
- `react-typescript.mdc` - React TypeScript specific rules
- `python-data-science.mdc` - Python data science workflows
- `security-focused.mdc` - Security-focused development
- `performance-optimization.mdc` - Performance-focused development

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create New Rules
- Starting a new project with specific requirements
- Working with a new technology stack
- Focusing on a particular domain (security, performance, etc.)
- Team has specific coding standards

### How to Test New Rules
1. Create the `.mdc` file in your project's `.cursorrules/` directory
2. Start a new Cursor chat to load the rules
3. Test with sample prompts relevant to your use case
4. Iterate based on the AI's responses
5. Share with team for feedback

### Best Practices
- Keep rules focused and specific
- Include concrete examples
- Update rules based on experience
- Share successful rules with the community
- Version control your rules files
