Enhanced Codebase Improvement Workflow
1. Codebase Review & Technical Debt Assessment
    * Review code architecture and organization
    * Identify areas with high complexity or technical debt
    * Run static analysis tools to find code smells and vulnerabilities
    * Create prioritized @TODO.md with specific technical improvements
2. Comprehensive Testing Strategy
    * Ensure unit test coverage for critical components
    * Implement integration and end-to-end tests for key user flows
    * Automate regression testing
    * Test edge cases and error handling specifically
3. Performance & Quality Evaluation
    * Conduct code profiling to identify bottlenecks
    * Measure and analyze key metrics (response times, memory usage)
    * Review code maintainability scores
    * Assess dependency health and security vulnerabilities
4. Technical Insights Development
    * Document patterns of recurring issues
    * Identify opportunities for refactoring
    * Evaluate technology stack components for potential upgrades
    * Analyze deployment and CI/CD pipeline efficiency
5. Architecture & Design Improvements
    * Review current architecture against evolving requirements
    * Brainstorm solutions for technical challenges
    * Design patterns for improved modularity and testability
    * Consider infrastructure and scalability optimizations
6. Systematic Implementation
    * Create feature branches for implementations
    * Follow code review process for all changes
    * Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
    * Implement automated testing for new code
7. Knowledge Capture & Process Refinement
    * Update documentation with implementation details
    * Refine coding standards based on lessons learned
    * Share knowledge through team code reviews
    * Update @TODO.md with new priorities and repeat cycleâ€¨
