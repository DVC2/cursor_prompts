# Contributing to Cursor Rules Collection

Welcome! üéâ We're excited you want to contribute to making AI-assisted development more efficient and intelligent. This repository contains advanced Cursor project rules that optimize AI agent behavior, and your contributions help the entire community.

## üéØ What We're Looking For

We welcome contributions that:
- **Optimize AI agent efficiency** (reduce tool calls, improve accuracy)
- **Solve real development problems** (based on actual usage patterns)
- **Integrate well** with existing rules (no conflicts or redundancy)
- **Are well-documented** with clear use cases and examples

## üöÄ How to Contribute

- **Edit or add `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`**
- **Test your rule in a real project for at least 1 week**
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description and examples**
- **No Node.js, npm, or extra tooling required**

## üöÄ How to Contribute New Rules

### 1. Identify a Need
Before creating a new rule, ensure it addresses a real problem:

```yaml
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Specific problem
Problem: "AI agents make 5+ tool calls for simple React component creation"
Solution: "React component generator with single-call templates"

# ‚ùå AVOID: Generic or duplicate
Problem: "Need better code quality"
Solution: "Generic linting rules" (already covered by commonsense.mdc)
```

### 2. Rule Categories

**Core Intelligence** (memory, sessions, learning):
- Memory management optimizations
- Session coordination
- Pattern recognition

**Workflow Optimization** (efficiency, debugging, practices):
- Tool call reduction
- Framework-specific optimizations
- Development workflow improvements

### 3. Rule Size Guidelines
- **Keep rules under 500 lines** - larger rules should be split
- **Focus on specific domains** - don't try to solve everything
- **Reuse existing patterns** - build on established rules

### 4. Concrete Example

Here's how to create a new rule for React development:

```markdown
# Before (inefficient):
AI makes 4 tool calls:
1. Create component file
2. Add imports
3. Add component code
4. Export component

# After (with rule):
AI makes 1 tool call with batched operations:
mkdir -p src/components/Button && cat << 'EOF' > src/components/Button/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
// ... complete component in one call
```

## üìã MDC File Format

### Structure
```yaml
---
description: Concise description of what this rule does (one sentence)
globs: 
  - "**/*.tsx"      # File patterns this rule applies to
  - "**/*.ts"       # Be specific to avoid conflicts
  - "components/**/*"
alwaysApply: false  # true for universal rules, false for conditional
---

# Rule Title

## üéØ Core Principle
Brief explanation of the rule's main purpose

## üìã Patterns

### Pattern Name
```language
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Example of what to do
const example = goodPattern();

// ‚ùå BAD: Example of what to avoid  
const example = badPattern();
```

### Implementation Templates
```bash
# Template for common operations
command1 && command2 && echo "‚úì Success"
```

## üîß Quick Reference
- Key points for quick lookup
- Common commands or patterns
- Troubleshooting tips
```

### Required Sections
1. **Core Principle** - Why this rule exists
2. **Patterns** - Specific examples with ‚úÖ/‚ùå
3. **Quick Reference** - Fast lookup information

### Optional Sections
- **Anti-patterns** - Common mistakes to avoid
- **Integration** - How it works with other rules
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting
1. **Real-world testing** - Use in actual projects for at least 1 week
2. **Performance measurement** - Document improvements quantitatively
3. **Integration testing** - Ensure compatibility with existing rules
4. **Edge case testing** - Test with different project structures

### Testing Checklist
```bash
# Test with different project types
‚úì Small project (< 100 files)
‚úì Medium project (100-1000 files) 
‚úì Large project (1000+ files)

# Test rule activation
‚úì Rule activates with correct file patterns
‚úì Rule doesn't activate outside intended scope
‚úì No conflicts with existing rules

# Test performance
‚úì Measure tool call reduction
‚úì Measure time savings
‚úì Measure accuracy improvements
```

### Performance Testing Example
```javascript
// Before rule implementation
const testResults = {
  toolCalls: 8,
  timeToComplete: 45000, // ms
  accuracy: 85,
  userSatisfaction: 7
};

// After rule implementation  
const improvedResults = {
  toolCalls: 3,           // 62% reduction
  timeToComplete: 18000,  // 60% faster
  accuracy: 95,           // 10% improvement
  userSatisfaction: 9     // 28% improvement
};
```

## üìä Documenting Performance Improvements

### Metrics to Track
1. **Tool Call Reduction** - Primary efficiency metric
2. **Time Savings** - Real-world time impact
3. **Accuracy Improvement** - Better first-attempt success rate
4. **User Experience** - Subjective satisfaction improvements

### Documentation Format
```markdown
## Performance Impact

- Tool calls: X per operation
- Time to complete: X seconds
- Success rate: X%

### After Rule  
- Tool calls: X per operation (Y% reduction)
- Time to complete: X seconds (Y% faster)
